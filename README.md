# Adversarial_Attacks_on_Image_Vision
this study explores the effectiveness of three adversarial attack algorithms, which are FGSM, BIM and PGD on three popular ImageNet pretrained neural network models: ResNet50, MobileNet_v2, and Inception_v3. Additionally, defense algorithm 'feature squeezing' is applied
